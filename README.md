[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Braintree support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```
composer require omnipay/braintree:"~2.0@dev"
```

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* Braintree

You need to set your `merchantId`, `publicKey` and `privateKey`. Setting `testMode` to true will use the `sandbox` environment.

This gateway supports purchase through a token (payment nonce) only. You can generate a clientToken for Javascript:

```php
$clientToken = $gateway->clientToken()->send()->getToken();
```

You can use the Braintree JavaScript client to generate the token for your CreditCard data.

```php
$response = $gateway->purchase([
            'amount' => '10.00',
            'token' => $_POST['payment_method_nonce']
        ])->send();
```
